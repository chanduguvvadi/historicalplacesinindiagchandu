    <b style="font-size: 25px; color: midnightblue;">1 . TAJ MAHAL</b><br><br>The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River 
    in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, 
    in the <b style="color:blue;"><i>Agra District in Uttar Pradesh.</i></b> It was built by Mughal Emperor <i><b style="color: blue;">Shah Jahan</b></i> 
    in memory of his wife <b><i><u>Mumtaz Mahal</u> </i></b> construction 
    starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard
     and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in <b>1653 AD</b>. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in 
     Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, 
     painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of
     the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran.<i><u> Ustad-Ahmad Lahori</u></i> was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.

    Sanchi is a small town situated in the <b style="color:blue;"><i>Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh</i></b>, India. It is renowned for its ancient <i><b>Buddhist site</b></i>,
     which is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a popular tourist destination. 
    Sanchi is located about 50 km northeast of Bhopal, the capital city of Madhya Pradesh, and is easily accessible by road or rail.
    The probable reason for the establishment of Buddhist monuments at Sanchi is the city of <b><i><u>Vidisha</u></i></b>. This erstwhile capital of ancient
     Eastern Malwa happened to be the populous and rich city of central India. The interest of the great Mauryan emperor Ashoka in Vidisha 
     and around was because his wife Devi belonged to Vidisha. In addition to this fact, the Sanchi hilltop was an ideal place for the 
     establishment of a monastery having a suitable atmosphere for meditation and other spiritual activities.

            <b style="color:blue;">The Red Fort or Lal Qila </i></b> is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of <b style="color:blue;"><i>Delhi, India,</i></b>
             that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort 
             on <b>12 May 1638</b>, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect
              <b><i><u>Ustad Ahmad Lahori</u></i></b>, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. 
            The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under <b style="color:blue;"><i>Shah Jahan </i></b>and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
            On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, <u>Jawaharlal Nehru,</u> raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour 
            flag at the fort's main gate.

Qutbu'd-Din Aibak laid the foundation of Minar in AD 1199 for the use of the mu'azzin (crier) to give calls for prayer and raised the 
first storey, to which were added three more storeys by his successor and son-in-law, <b style="color:blue;"><i>Shamsu'd-Din Iltutmish (AD 1211-36)</i></b>. 
All the storeys are surrounded by a projected balcony encircling the minar and 
supported by stone brackets, which are decorated with honey-comb design, more conspicuously in the first storey.

            The Gateway of India is an arch-monument completed in 1924 on the waterfront of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of George V for his coronation as the Emperor of India in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain. He was the first British monarch to visit India.

            The foundation stone was laid in <b style="color:blue;"><i>March 1913</i></b> for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 
            16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, 
            and construction was completed in <b style="color:blue;"><i>1924</i></b>. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is <b style="color:blue;"><i>26 metres (85 feet) high</i></b>, 
            with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.

            During the Gupta period (5th and 6th centuries A.D.), many more richly decorated caves were added 
            to the original group. The paintings and sculptures of Ajanta, considered masterpieces of <b style="color:blue;"><i>Buddhist religious art</i></b>,
             have had a considerable artistic influence.Buddhist rock-cut cave temples and monasteries, located near <b style="color:blue;"><i>Ajanta village, 
             north-central Maharashtra state, western India,</i></b> that are celebrated for their wall paintings. The temples are hollowed out of
              granite cliffs on the inner side of a 70-foot (20-metre) ravine in 
             the Wagurna River valley 65 miles (105 km) northeast of Aurangabad, at a site of great scenic beauty.

                            Charminar was built by <b style="color:blue;"><i>Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591</i></b>. It is said that this square shaped 
                            structure with four pillars and intricate carvings was built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati. However, the 
                            actual reason behind building Charminar is still not clear.

As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the plague which had affected the entire city 
immensely during that era. It is believed that the Sultan had prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering. 
Hence, as the plague ended, he built the charminar as a tribute to Allah.
 The <b style="color:blue;"><i>four pillars</i></b> are also said to be dedicated to the first four caliphs of Islam.
